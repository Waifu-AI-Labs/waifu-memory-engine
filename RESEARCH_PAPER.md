# Waifu Memory Engine: A Context-Aware Memory System for Conversational AI Characters

## Abstract

The Waifu Memory Engine presents a novel approach to persistent memory management in conversational AI systems, specifically designed for anime-style virtual characters (waifus). This system implements advanced memory storage, retrieval, and association mechanisms to enable AI characters to maintain coherent, long-term conversational context and develop consistent personalities through user interactions. The engine employs natural language processing techniques, emotion tracking, and semantic memory associations to create more engaging and personalized AI experiences.

This research presents a memory engine designed to:
- Provide persistent, contextual memory for AI characters
- Implement semantic memory associations for enhanced context retrieval

| Database | SQLite 3 | Local data persistence |
| NLP Library | NLTK | Text processing and analysis |
| Language | Python 3.8+ | Core implementation |
| Data Format | JSON | API communication |

### 2.3 Database Schema

The system employs a relational database design with the following key entities:

```sql
-- Core memory storage
CREATE TABLE memories (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    character TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    memory_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- conversation, preference, event, fact, relationship, milestone
    emotion TEXT,
    importance REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_accessed DATETIME,
    access_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    metadata TEXT  -- JSON-encoded additional data
);

-- Emotional state tracking
CREATE TABLE emotional_states (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    character TEXT NOT NULL,
    emotion TEXT NOT NULL,
    intensity REAL NOT NULL,  -- 0.0 to 1.0
    context TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    duration INTEGER DEFAULT 3600  -- seconds
);

-- Memory associations for semantic linking
CREATE TABLE memory_associations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    memory_id_1 INTEGER,
    memory_id_2 INTEGER,
    association_strength REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
    association_type TEXT,  -- keyword, temporal, emotional, semantic
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User-character relationships
CREATE TABLE relationships (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    character TEXT NOT NULL,
    relationship_level REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
    trust_level REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
    affection_level REAL DEFAULT 0.5,
    interaction_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_interaction DATETIME
);
```

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Memory Importance Calculation

The system employs a multi-factor importance scoring algorithm:

```python
def calculate_memory_importance(content, memory_type, emotional_weight, keywords):
    base_importance = {
        'conversation': 0.3, 'preference': 0.8, 'event': 0.6,
        'fact': 0.5, 'relationship': 0.9, 'milestone': 0.95
    }[memory_type]
    
    content_factor = min(1.0, len(content) / 200) * 0.1
    emotion_factor = abs(emotional_weight) * 0.2
    keyword_factor = min(0.15, len(keywords) / 20)
    
    return min(1.0, base_importance + content_factor + emotion_factor + keyword_factor)
```

### 3.2 Semantic Memory Retrieval

Memory retrieval combines SQL-based filtering with NLP similarity scoring:

1. **Primary Filtering**: SQL queries filter by user, character, memory type, and importance threshold
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Jaccard similarity between query keywords and memory keywords
3. **Combined Ranking**: Weighted combination of importance (60%) and relevance (40%)

### 3.3 Emotion Tracking Model

The emotion system implements:
- **Categorical Classification**: Emotions grouped into positive, negative, neutral, and special categories
- **Intensity Scaling**: Continuous intensity values (0.0-1.0) with temporal decay
- **State Transitions**: Emotion compatibility matrix for realistic emotional progressions

```python
# Emotion decay function
new_intensity = current_intensity * exp(-decay_rate * hours_passed)

# Compatibility matrix (examples)
emotion_compatibility = {
    ('happy', 'excited'): 1.2,    # Reinforcing
    ('sad', 'angry'): 0.8,        # Dampening
    ('surprised', 'curious'): 1.1  # Synergistic
}
```

### 3.4 Keyword Extraction Pipeline

Natural language processing follows a standard pipeline:

1. **Text Cleaning**: Normalization, special character removal
2. **Tokenization**: Word boundary identification using NLTK
3. **Filtering**: Stop word removal, minimum length filtering
4. **Stemming**: Porter Stemmer for morphological normalization
5. **Frequency Analysis**: Term frequency ranking for keyword selection

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 API Endpoints

The system exposes RESTful endpoints for:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/memory/store` | POST | Store new memory entries |
| `/memory/retrieve` | POST | Query-based memory retrieval |
| `/memory/preferences` | POST | Categorized preference retrieval |
| `/emotion/update` | POST | Emotional state updates |
| `/emotion/current` | POST | Current emotion retrieval |
| `/integration/context` | POST | Conversation context for chat systems |
| `/integration/process_conversation` | POST | Automated conversation processing |
| `/analysis/keywords` | POST | Text analysis and keyword extraction |

### 4.2 Memory Association Algorithm

Memory associations are created through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Keyword-Based**: Jaccard similarity > 0.3 threshold
2. **Temporal**: Memories created within configurable time windows
3. **Emotional**: Similar emotional states and intensities
4. **Semantic**: Content-based similarity using NLP techniques

### 4.3 Performance Optimizations

- **Database Indexing**: Multi-column indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automated removal of low-importance, old memories
- **Access Pattern Tracking**: Usage-based importance adjustment
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management

## 5. Integration Capabilities

### 5.1 Chat System Integration

The engine integrates with conversational AI systems through context provision:

```python
# Context retrieval for enhanced responses
context = {
    'recent_memories': [last 5 conversation memories],
    'current_emotion': {emotion: 'happy', intensity: 0.7},
    'memory_summary': {preference: 12, conversation: 45, event: 3},
    'personality_indicators': ['loves cats', 'enjoys anime', 'prefers chocolate']
}
```

### 5.2 Voice Synthesis Integration

Emotional states inform voice parameter modulation:

```python
# Emotion-to-voice parameter mapping
voice_params = {
    'speed': 1.0 + (emotion_intensity * speed_modifier),
    'pitch': base_pitch + (emotion_intensity * pitch_modifier),
    'volume': base_volume + (emotion_intensity * volume_modifier)
}
```
